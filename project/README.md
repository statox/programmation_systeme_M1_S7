- if sum is big enough (isDefragUseful)
    - remove unused memory from blocks (length = usedLength)
    - create two new blocks at the end (addEnd)
        - one to fit needs perfectly
        - one for other needs

@Matthieudelaro tell me if you think something is missing.

Then we will have to make the report
